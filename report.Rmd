This is a report about `r params$penguin_species` penguins. Their average weight is `r avg_penguin_weight` grams.

Here is a chart that shows the distribution of their weights. 

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == params$penguin_species) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
